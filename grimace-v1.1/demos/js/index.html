<h1>Happ it!</h1>
<h2>Make it a Happy Habit! </h2>
<br/>
Ever wondered how your emotions change over time and vary between regions? (or if the weather impacts it for example)? Or wondered how your friends are feeling at the moment?
<br/>
Happit helps you express your feelings, share it with your friends and store it for your own later reference.
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
The app allows you to self evaluate your emotions by rating 6 basic feelings on a scale from 0 to 1, whenever you want to express yourself like a diary or share it with others. 
<br/>
Based on your historic data you can navigate in time and see how surprise yourself by seeing how your feelings have changed throughout different times and events, or based on the places you have been to. You can also see your friend's happiness diary if it's shared with you or public. 
<br/>
The data in anonymized form can also be used for enterprises or law makers to improve general well-being, e.g. if people in one neighborhood are particularly unhappy, government could invest more into parks, facilities etc in that area or restaurants can learn that people are particularly happy on a specific day or event. This tool could even be used for peer study groups.
